The exposed section of the flint has been worked creating three visible long sloping faces and a flat upper surface on the upper dorsal side. The ventral front edge has been worked with short, scaled semi-abrupt retouch. The flint is a black to translucent brown colour. The body of the flint is wrapped in a piece of folded lead, or \"flint pad\", intended to hold it in place within the jaws of a cock or hammer on a flintlock firearm. There appears to be a partial impression from the lock clamp on the upper surface of the lead. Measurements: length 33.01mm, width 24.07mm, thickness 11.81mm, weight 17.46g. Discussion: Other recorded gunflints with lead pads include BERK-736C0C; KENT-CBEAF2 and NMS-A24189 which notes that the flintlock was introduced in the middle of the 16th century and became the main regulation firearm for the British Army during the reign of William III. The knapped flint was used within the musket mechanism to produce a spark and could last between 20-25 shots before it had to be replaced.",

                    "label": "A complete&nbsp;silver finger ring of probable medieval date (c.1000-1200). Description: The ring is sub-circular in plan, with the back section of the hoop being rectangular in cross-section and the front sub-circular, being formed with three twisted sub-rectangular wires which have been split from the band.&nbsp;At some points on the wires, possible peck marks are evident which were used to test the quality of the silver.&nbsp; Measurements:&nbsp;diameter: 24mm; width: 3.8mm; thickness: 1.2mm; height (of bezel): 3.5mm; weight: 3.91g Discussion: Typically, silver finger rings formed of twisted wire have a very narrow back such as NCL-40E866, sometimes the join of two tapering ends such as&nbsp;KENT-4D4DB5, both of which are attributed to Viking production and dated c.800-1100. Those with rectangular backs such as the one recorded here are less common but include&nbsp;SUSS-6F8D1D, dated c.800-1100, and which references multiple gold parallels including&nbsp;YORYM-F67716&nbsp;dated 9th-11th century.&nbsp; It also references an almost identical example to the ring recorded here in the British Museums collections (1854,0820.6) which was &#39;...found in the Lark Hill Hoard near Worcester. This hoard is dated to the 12th century by the presence of coins contained therein, but the ring is described in the British Museum&#39;s collection database as being &#39;a common type of Viking and late Anglo-Saxon ring&#39;. KENT-EA1868&nbsp;is the closest parallel that could be found on the database and includes the following discussion: ...the twisted hoop type of Viking origin is long-lived in Denmark, in fact into the early 12th century, while in England, a ring of plain rods with a plain section hammered square at the back was found in the Lark Hill Hoard, deposited later around 1173-1174 (F. Lindahl, 2003, Symboler I guld og s&oslash;lv, Nationalmuseets fingerringe 1000-1700-&aring;rene, Copenhagen, 11-13, figs. 3 and 12).&nbsp; It also refers to &#39;...a silver-gilt ring of alternating twisted rods and finer twisted wires with a long, plain, rectangular section at the back, like the one from Old Romney, from a late 13th or early 14th-century context at Hangleton, Sussex (E.W. Holden, 1963, &#39;Excavations at the deserted medieval village of Hangleton, part 1&#39;, Sussex Archaeological Collections, 54-181, fig. 38, 18). The form and structure of both these rings are closely comparable with a further silver stray find from either England, or possibly the Near East, in the Haedeke Collection (H.-U. Haedeke, 2000, Schmuck aus drei Jahrtausenden, Cologne, 86, cat.no. 118)&#39;.&nbsp; It concludes: &#39;It would appear from the occurrences in early Medieval contexts, therefore, that such rings of multiple, twisted rods with longish arcs of square section at the back of the hoop and less &#39;corrugated&#39; appearance represent a development of the Viking form and can be dated to the Romanesque period.&#39; A date of c.1000-1200 is therefore suggested for the example recorded here.",

One surface is almost flat and the other slightly convex possibly with the remains of a midrib. The tang is also lenticular in cross section with opposing convex surfaces. The surface extending from the flat side of the blade steeply convex and the opposing side extending from the midrib side is gently convex and almost flat. The tang measures12.44mm at the base of the blade tapering to a point. It thickens from 7.68mm tapering to 1.75mm at the tip. The side profile of the tang terminates in a curve with a sharply upturned tip.The object is covered in pale green corrosion, but is a bright copper underneath. Measurements: length: 91.86mm; width: 32.78mm; thickness of blade: 7.31mm and weight: 51.75g. Discussion: The upturned tang would have held the original wood, bone or antler handle in place.

Those carrying initials are generally deemed to be post-Medieval in date (1500-1850), those which seem to mimic Medieval penny designs are deemed to be Medieval, the remainder which carry stylised designs remain difficult to date but the majority are probably post-Medieval in date c. 1500-1850.",

                    "label": "Description: A complete silver annular brooch, with zoomorphic decoration, dating to the medieval period (c.AD1200-1300). The brooch frame is circular in plan, with protruding flattened flanges for the pin loop and rest, and broadly D-shaped in section with a flat undecorated reverse. The tapering pin is again broadly D-shaped in section, with a pronounced transverse ridge (possibly a collar) prior to the point at which it is folded through the piercing in the frame. Decorating the frame either side of the pin loop and rest, are two double headed 'beasts'. The heads of the beasts are presented in relief, with squared snouts, pellet eyes set in slight depressions on either side, and separated ears swept back along the body. Two voided saltire crosses decorate the latter, with regularly spaced pellets infilling the resulting lozenges. Dimensions: Brooch frame diameter: 26.42mm; height: 1.2mm; width: 3.6mm Brooch pin length: 24.56mm; thickness: 1.58mm Weight: 4.3g Discussion: Annular brooches of this form, with the pin lopping through a hole in the frame, are illustrated by Egan and Pritchard (2010, 251: 1316), and are accorded a medieval date. Whilst examples featuring zoomorphic decoration are notably absent from Egan and Pritchard (2010), a number of similar brooches have been recorded on the PAS database of which two, 2013-T886 (DOR-5CC922) and 2016-T634 (YORYM-9A191A), are of an almost identical form, save for some variation with the voided cross and pellet design of the beast's body. Both brooches are dated to the 13th century. The beasts depicted on the frame of the brooch are probably intended to be dragons, with the decoration along the body representing the dragon's scales. Depictions of dragons are described as \"near-ubiquitous in medieval manuscripts\" and art, often featuring on jewellery and heraldic devices (Biggs 2014). Not all depictions conform to the modern preconception of the 'typical 'dragon: a miniature of 'St George and the dragon' from an early 15th century manuscript depicts a more lizard like creature not dissimilar from those depicted in relief on the brooches described above (Biggs 2014; Anon c.1401). Interestingly, the miniature also shows the dragon's back decorated with a cross-hatch and lozenge design comparable to that of brooch 2019-T506. Conclusion: The age and precious metal content of this object meets the criteria for Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.

                    "label": "A fragment from a copper alloy cruciform brooch, specifically a 'Florid' head-plate knob, dating to the early medieval period (AD525-570). The knob comprises an almost spatulate terminus with lappet-like projections to either side of the main body of the the knob. Above the lappets the knob constricts, widening again at a ridge with an adjacent ragged edge denoting the point at which the knob has broken away from the head-plate. The main element of the knob is decorated with an anthropomorphised Stalin's Style I face, comprising two oval eyes with defined eyebrows and pupils (in an almost 'petal boss' form) above a widening nose, and the spatulate terminus forming a moustache. The 'ears' of the face (the lappet-like protrusions) are in turn decorated with the classic 'Helmed Profile' which in this instance have developed almost to a spiral (see Martin 2015, 155 and 157) . The reverse of the brooch is flat and undecorated. The overall patina of the knob is green, with some brown traces particularly apparent on elements of the decoration. Whilst corrosion is evident, the knob is in fairly good condition overall, making the detail of the decoration visible. Length: 30.14 mm Width: 32.97 mm Thickness: 3.72 mm Weight: 12.3 g The 'Florid' form of the \"...laterally expanded, planate head-plate knob...\" featuring \"..elaborate [Salin's] Style I motifs.\" is sufficient to classify the brooch as a Martin Group 4 Cruciform Brooch (Martin 2015, 64). The brown traces along the \"contour-lines\" of the face may be evidence of characteristic 'bichrome' or gold and silver decoration found on these brooches (ibid; Haseloff 1974, 8). Assigning the brooch to a more specific 'Type' based on the knob alone is somewhat difficult; However, the knobs of Type 4.5.1 \"Catterick\", distinguished by \"helmed profiles that erupt from the top of the mask's head...\", are distinctly similar to that of the brooch under discussion here (Martin 2015, 77). The distribution for this brooch type is also consistent, with a distinct group in the\" far north\" around the Tees, with examples found at both Norton Cemetery, and nearby Catterick (ibid, 77 and 291). As such the knob (and thus the brooch) would belong to Martin's Cruciform brooch Phase C, and would date to between c.AD525-570 (ibid, 128) References Haseloff, G., 1974. Salin's Style I.

                    "label": "Description: The hoard comprises 20 silver pennies of the Long Cross type introduced by Edward I in 1279 (c.1282-1310). There are two Scottish coins: one of Alexander III's Second Coinage (c.1280-92), and one of John Baliol (c.1292-96). The coins date from between 1280 and 1310. The coins were recovered from an arable field, spread over an area of approximately 20 metres. It is likely that the hoard was deposited during a single episode in an organic container that has since decomposed. No pottery sherds or other related finds were identified. Summary: 18 coins from the reign of Edward I (r. 1272-1307) 1 coin from the reign of Alexander III (r. 1249-1286) 1 coin from the reign of John Baliol (r. 1292-1296) The coins are good silver, were likely in circulation together, represent a selected body of material (in that the lesser denominations of halfpenny and farthing are not present) and were probably deposited early in the reign of Edward II, probably in the 1330s.

                    "label": "A complete cast silver phallic amulet or pendant of Roman date&nbsp;(c. 42-410 AD).&nbsp; Description: The object has a roughly reverse triangular top section (7.02mm tall) with ribbed decoration, presumably pubic hair, narrowing to a tapering shaft (16.2mm long) and terminating in a raised band foreskin 10.07mm from the terminus at the front and 3mm on the reverse, and rounded bulbous glans. There is an integrally cast tubular suspension loop (6.7m diameter, 5.73mm wide) on the reverse of the top section.&nbsp; Dimensions:&nbsp; 30.94mm long, 12.28mm wide, 9.3mm thick including hanging loop. Weighs 9.7g Discussion: Roman phallic pendants acted as protective amulets against the effects of &#39;the evil eye&#39;,&nbsp;a personification of bad luck (Parker 2021). Most phallic amulets were&nbsp;worn by people and animals, the vast majority being made from copper-alloy (for copper-alloy examples recorded on the database see SUSS-0DF903;&nbsp;PUBLIC-56B4BD; LIN-9DF6E7; SF-49E6A6).&nbsp;They were designed to be gaudy and noticeable in order to work properly as amulets. The archaeological contexts of stratified examples, along with phallic wall carvings, such as at Hadrian&#39;s wall, suggest a close association with military sites. This is supported by written evidence with&nbsp;Pliny&nbsp;(Nat.Hist. 28.39)&nbsp;attributing&nbsp;the phallus to the embodiment of Fascinus, the guardian of infants and generals. The association of the phallus with children is also mentioned by Varro&nbsp;(Ling. 7.97) who noted &#39;a certain indecent object that is hung on the neck of boys to prevent harm coming to them...&#39;. The archaeological evidence also supports this&nbsp;association between children and phallic pendants, with five&nbsp;&#39;fist-and-phallus&#39; pendants being recovered from a single&nbsp;infant inhumation at Catterick (Parker 2015), and a horned phallus amulet found in an infant burial in Colchester (Crummy 2010) as well as small-fitting finger rings such as&nbsp;BUC-C9CEE4.&nbsp; Of the 451 phallic objects from Roman Britain recorded as part of Adam parker&rsquo;s PhD, only a single one was silver (pers.comm.). That one object is a dual-sided pendant from the Caerleon bath-house: &ldquo;Dual-sided, ithyphallic, silver pendant depicted as lateral bar tapering from centre to either terminal with shared pair of central, globular, testes. A small annular suspension loop is above&rdquo; (Brewer 1986a:167-168). Although only one other silver phallic pendant is recorded on the database (BM-A0BEB2),&nbsp;gold examples can be seen&nbsp;on the database at&nbsp;&nbsp;SWYOR-E56143&nbsp;and&nbsp;ESS-0CDDC1&nbsp;which have&nbsp;a similarly placed suspension loops. This example is different in form to most example recorded on the database however, with the omission of testicles, and the inclusion of pubic hair. The main phallic object class with public hair is the Flaccid phallic pendants. It is therefore likely that this pendant is depicting a flaccid macrophallus, rather than an erect one, with the possibility that, rather than representing the ability to target and defeat the evil eye, a lack of control and an almost barbaric sexuality is suggested (Adam Parker,&nbsp;Pers. Comms.) The triangular portion of this type&nbsp;can be seen&nbsp;on other flaccid phallic objects including harness pendants such as&nbsp;OXON-551EFE, strap mounts such as&nbsp;DENO-B0E1C1&nbsp;as well as pendants such as&nbsp;DENO-C0709A, however large testes are a significant feature of these objects. It is not possible to narrowly date this pendant, as not direct parallel with secure dating evidence can be found. The large corpus of phallic imagery across the Roman Empire however, strongly&nbsp;points to a exclusively &#39;Roman&#39; tradition, and thus, in the case of phallic objects found in Roman Britain, a date of 43-410 AD can be confidently assigned.&nbsp; Conclusion: It is therefore clear that this object likely dates to before 1721&nbsp;and, as the object is made of more than 10% precious metals, it constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996",

Description: The axe is broadly rectangular in plan and ovoid in profile. The blade of the palstave has straight sides that flare to form a crescent shaped cutting edge. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile). The two sides flare progressively from the butt to the raised and thickened stop. The flanges are fused to the stop and the septum of the axe is relatively plain and undecorated. The casting seams and associated flashes on either side (long edge) have been trimmed and hammered almost flat. An integrally cast side loop descends on one edge; it is positioned immediately below the stop towards the blade. The loop is D-shaped in cross-section. Below the stop ridge of the axe on the upper blade is a central rib which continues towards the cutting edge of the blade, tapering to flatness at about 25mm from the cutting edge. The rib is present on both faces - although better defined on one. Each face has two further ribs which run from the butt to join the central rib at 20mm towards the blade - again one side is more defined. The palstave has a well-defined polished dark green/brown coloured surface patina which is pitted and broken in places, exposing areas of corrosion, particularly along the external and raised edges. Measurments: length: 170mm; width (across the blade): 61.63mm; width (across the butt): 20.8mm; thickness (across the stop): 25.22mm; thickness (of the septum in the mid point of the butt): 7.14mm. The side flanges raise to a height of 9.2mm above the septum. The axehead weighs 387.6 grams. Discussion: There is a similar but incomplete example on this database at DENO-07C564.",

The sheets sandwich a third piece of copper-alloy which maybe a third sheet or a spacer to assist with its attachment to its strap. The plates are sub rectangular in plan, tapering slightly towards the closed end which is pointed and terminates in a small knop. The attachment is finished leaving it slightly concave.

The cascabel has a globular knob and then expands into the first reinforce, there is a small thin reinforce just past this. The touch hole is placed passed the second reinforce on an un-modelled part of the barrel.. The trunnions are centrally positioned and projected evenly to either side. With the touch-hole facing up, the trunnions appear to be slightly off centre sitting low on the barrel. The barrel tapers slightly before flaring at the muzzle. It is decorated with a number of incised single bands evenly placed along the barrel. The muzzle flares outwards. The object would have originally had wheels and a wooden gun carriage, all of which have subsequently been lost or decayed in the ground. The object is a dark grey-green with some patches of light-mid green patina. Measurements: Length: 30.09mm, 10.81mm wide (across trunnions, 5.92mm max width of body of the cannon), 5.86mm thick and Weighs: 2.98g. Discussion: Forsyth and Egan (2005, 80-81) suggest firing toy cannons were very popular by the end of the 16th century, but the majority show features that were developed in the 17th - 18th century.",

There are no decorative details apparent. The object has a dark to mid-green patina. Similar objects recorded on the PAS database include: DEV-60ACE4 and SWYOR-0E6CA1.

It has a sandy appearance, with some large dark inclusions but also white inclusions which appear to be shell used as temper. In the main this is crushed to a fine consistency, but there is one particularly noticeable shell inclusion present on the lower part of the handle, on the outer surface, which is distinctive. It is slightly reminiscent, although more orange than grey in colour, of fabric 23 from the Exeter excavations (Allan et al 1984:33) although it is likely locally produced, possibly at the pottery kilns known at Plympton and Bere Ferrers. The pear shaped jug form is used throughout the later medieval period. Measurements: 86mm width, 117mm length, weight tbc",

The finger ring comprises a circular hoop with rectangular section which widens to an integral flat sub-ovate bezel. The bezel bear incised decoration featuring a central lozenge with a double square-box frame with inwardly curved sides. The box is flanked by three parallel grooves which narrow into the hoop. The interior of the hoop is undecorated. Dimensions: Diameter: 19.2mm; Bezel Width: 7.9mm; Hoop Width: 1.9mm; Thickness: 1.9mm; Weight: 1.2g. Discussion: This finger ring is similar in form, though perhaps somewhat more crude, than a number of examples recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database. See: 2014 T899 (YORYM-03DF22), 2010 T520 (DENO-A0AFF8), 2012 T639 (NMS-EFD014) and 2017 T614 (LANCUM-E195C6). All have been dated to the 12th or 13th centuries on the basis of a similar example found in the Lark Hill hoard, now in the British Museum, which also contained coins of Tealby type and is thought to have been deposited in the late 12th century.",

The lobes are divided by ridged projecting collars forming cusps between the lobes. The wider end forms the clip. It has a double collar between it and the adjacent lobe. The end curves downwards but appears to be complete. It is decorated with cast ridges running longitudinally with the whole fitting. The three lobes get progressively smaller from the clip to the narrow terminal. Each contains a circular rivet hole, two with traces of iron corrosion. There is a double collar between each lobe and the next. The final, terminal lobe is circular. The front of the object is moulded, but the reverse is flat apart from a concave area on the reverse of the clip end, and the nd of the clip projecting downwards slightly. The mount is 23.9mm long, 7.7mm wide; 2.2mm thick and weighs 2.30g. It is a brown colour. While it is not certain what this mount would have been attached to, a Medieval date is suggested based on stylistic similarities with other objects such as harness pendant suspension mounts (compare KENT-42DC4A), spur buckles (SWYOR-3B9AB1 for example, especially the circular terminal and projecting collars) and casket mounts such as WAW-201866. The latter cites Egan 1998 that transverse ridge decoration is commonly found in the Medieval period. Though there is no close parallel among the casket mounts in Egan (1998), there is similarity of style. It has also been pointed out that there is similarity to Post Medieval toggle, clasp or sword belt fittings of circa AD 1600-1700.

The closed end terminal is rounded and broken, with no extant obviously zoomorphic characteristics \u2013 the snout of a beast appears to have been broken off. The reverse of the plate is plain, while the upper surface is decorated in the Trewhiddle style. The major motif is a single stylised dog-like animal, facing left towards the split end, but not with his head turned back towards the closed end terminal. There are chin lappets detatched from the head, filling the space between the head and the raised forepaw. The body of the beast is adorned with triangular punchmarks. The space at the split end between the rivet holes and the panel is filled with a spatulate palmette decorated with a chevron. To the right, towards the terminal is a collar consisting of a single transverse line, and three longitudinal lines, probably the ears of the missing zoomorphic head on the broken terminal. Traces of niello might be discerned, while some areas are stained with a dark red residue, possibly depositional contagion from an iron object.

The flat-topped mouth is sub-oval (56.8mm x 50.3mm) with a sub oval socket (36.9mm x 32.4mm and with a maximum depth, containing sediment of 41mm). Three of the four casting runner stubs are evident on the face but have been carefully removed. The mouth moulding has a prominent lip on most of one face but the other face has the usual bevelled-steeped moulding. The sub-circular loop (with a length of 37mm) springs from the moulding on one side and has broken just above the moulding. Both breaks on the loop appear to be recent. The sides have a gentle concavity long their lengths and are bevelled to the centre across their thicknesses. The casting seams are clearly discernible but have been neatly finished. The sides diverge to the gently expanded blade edge (with a width of 58.0mm), which has a very gently curvature. The original blade edge has been lost. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs, which descend from the moulding and continue for most of the faces (with a length of 66mm). Additionally the edges of the faces are raised, suggesting further ribs. The faces are otherwise gently convex across their widths and near straight across their length, before converging more sharply at the blade, below the ribs but with no blade facet. Hammer facets are discernible on both blades. The surface has a dark-green patina and traces of probable tenorite survive on the upper part of the faces and along the length of both sides. There are crude incised marks on both blades, lying beneath the patina and seemingly deliberate, the marks generally extend from the ribs, including the sides and end before the blade edge. There are addition incised marks running across the blades crossing the verticals. Some of the marks are doubled in areas, suggesting a secondary attempt on the same alignment and implying a deliberate design was attempted. A number of sharpening striations are also evident running both along and perpendicular to the blade edge.",

The wings are also decorated with a double-stranded vertical groove towards the bow head. The axis bar, spring and pin are missing. At the centre of the upper edge of the wings/bow head there is an incomplete integral hook. The bowhead is hump-like in profile with a moulding either side, and is undecorated. The bow tapers and is oval in section and tapers to a broken edge above the mid-point. The surface of the brooch has a matte mid green patina. It measures 19.87mm in length, 32.96mm in width, and weighs 8.89g. The brooch is a Polden Hill type, Bayley and Butcher (2004:160) comment that the distribution of Polden Hill brooches are concentrated in the West Midlands.

Standing at almost 2m tall, Kilnassagart Inscribed Stone is regarded as being one of the oldest inscribed stones in Ireland.

Excavations at the site in 1966 and 1968 revealed an early Christian graveyard with graves oriented radially around the pillar and facing towards the rising sun.

It is a mid-brown colour with patches of light green. The obverse detail survives best. The centre of the coin face is taken up with what appears to be a large 'V' but is intended to be a 'Y'. To the right and lower right of the 'Y' there are what appear to be two small 'V's. These are well spaced apart and oriented vertically compared to the large 'Y'. It is possible that these represent two number '7' s. To the right of the '7's and arranged along the edge of the coin there is a very faint suggestion of a further inscription. This appears to be 'IN' but it is difficult to be sure because of the level of decay. There is also raised detail surviving on the reverse but this is virtually indecipherable. Assessment: This appears to be a copper 'maravedis' coin of Spanish origin. These coins were mass produced for circulation in the New World from the early 16th century. The 'Y' on the obverse suggests this may be an early version of this coin. Both Ferdinand and Isabella (1474-1504), and Charles and Johanna (1516 to 1555) used this device.",

The frame was of oval or circular form (with a diameter of 23mm) and of oval section (3.3mm wide and 3.8mm thick). Heavy corrosion on the frame has removed any trace of possible decoration. The pin is looped through a slot behind the frame. The ferrous pin is comparatively short (at 17mm) and is of D-shaped section, with straight sides, gradually converging to the tip. The buckle narrows behind the frame (to 9.2mm) before widening to the sub-square integral plate (12.6mm wide, 9mm long and 2.3mm thick). The buckle was attached using a single rivet, positioned near the centre of the plate and appears to have been of iron. No decoration is evident on the plate. The attachment end of the plate is heavily-corroded but does not appear to be broken. The surface has a dark-green patina beneath the grey-brown corrosion. The buckle for is difficult to closely parallel, with integral buckle plates generally being longer and occasionally with a hooked end, such as the examples recorded in London (Egan & Pritchard, 1991, nos. 320-1, p 78)[1]. It remains possible that this buckle was of similar form and has now lost the rear of the plate.

The brooch has the characteristic cast S-shaped form and is of flat section (4.6mm thick). The face is decorated with four curvilinear cells containing alternating red and (currently) green enamel arranged each side of a central transverse border. The surface is heavily corroded and any other decorative details have now been lost. The rear of the brooch is undecorated and slightly concave. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted with a dark-green patina. It seems likely that the item is an incomplete Dragonesque brooch, but may also have been a decorative enamelled S-shaped mount, or decorative element from a larger object. Dragonesque brooches are a British native type with few recorded examples from Wales or the west of Britain, with many being recovered from frontier areas in Northern Britain.",

The basal loop is integral and sub-rectangular (21.5mm wide and 8.5mm deep with internal dimensions of 13.4mm x 4.2mm) and with a sub-rectangular to oval sectioned frame (5.5mm wide and 4mm thick). Above the loop there is an oval moulding (7.5mm long and 12.6mm wide) with a convex upper edge (7.4mm deep). Above the moulding, the hoop is flat and rectangular-sectioned but somewhat irregular in width and thickness (with a thickness of 2.7mm \u2013 5.9mm). The hoop is widest at its base (at 10mm) and gradually narrows towards its apex (to 5.5mm). On the interior of the hoop are decorative opposing \u2018C\u2019 scrolls with a bifurcating tope edge. No applied decoration is evident on the terret. Areas of wear are discernible on the inside of the hoop, particularly to one side of the apex. The surface has a dark-green patina with some finishing striations evident beneath the patina. The terret is comparatively elaborate compared to many recovered examples of strap-mounted terrets, which tend to have few decorative features and is difficult to closely parallel. Note: The record was written before Lewis\u2019 (2015) typology was published. Using Lewis\u2019 typology this terret may be assigned to the \u201cDropped Bar\u201d type, which belongs to the imported types group, firmly dating terrets of this type to the 1st and 2nd centuries post Claudian invasion.",

Discussion The coins were found within a limited area and therefore it is more likely than not that they were originally associated in the ground. The latest issues are irregular issues from the time of Carausius (usurper in Britain, 286/7-93) adding the hoard to the many recorded from Wales that were buried during this reign. Late third-century hoards typically include only the highly-debased issues from around 260 onwards. This new find is therefore unusual in having a significant content of the earlier coins and thereby a value as bullion; the continued availability of 'silver' coins in the late third century may relate to the relatively remote location in Roman Britain.",

The coin was sent to the National Museum of Wales, and proved to be an almost unworn aureus of Claudius I, struck at Rome AD 51-52. The names of the farm and of the barn - Ysgubor Aur - adjoining the field in which the discovery was made, incorporate the Welsh word for metallic gold and suggest that a hoard existed at some remote time; although a careful visual search, coupled with the use of a mine-detector kindly supplied by the Territorial Army H.Q., Cardiff (proved to be capable of detecting gold if shallowly buried) failed to reveal other coins. The site, however, is a sloping field at the foot of Coed y Prior, a steep hillside flanking the eastern edge of the uplands which terminate northward in the Blorenge; and the lower part of the field, where the coin was found, is deep in hill-wash. A hoard buried in Coed y Prior, if disturbed by natural agency, would probably have become dispersed, in time, over a very wide area. The condition of the aureus suggests loss or burial within a year or two of mintage. \" G.C. Boon, in BBCS XIX (1961-2), 345f. G.C. Boon, in Monmouths.

The obverse face has bold radiating ribs producing a corrugated surface, of Spencer's (1990, p 59)[1] Type I and indicating the scallop shell, the emblem of Saint James and representing pilgrimage.
